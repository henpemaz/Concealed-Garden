(2)My last moments were full of regret. Regret for leaving my work behind. Regret for  <LINE>not accomplishing what I wanted. Regret for not being bold enough to stay.          
(0,1)I've grown used to watching the stars from here. Even after the clouds conquered the surface,<LINE>for a while you could still see most of these bright spots in the sky, fading in and out.         <LINE>Observing them from here feels more... precious than the crude view from an Iterator's structure. 
(2)I've always been more in syntony with my work than with the universe. Others didn't feel the same.        <LINE>They thought we were doing this as a gift to the world. I was doing it for myself, to justify my own existence.
(0,1)The universe calls but I have no voice to answer, no body to fight back, no more a shell to hide in.<LINE>I refuse to abandon my work and it refuses to let me finish it.         
We did our best, and yet the universe did not care. We were Almost Sure to find an answer,                        <LINE>but the odds were never in our favor. So determined as we were, we built machines upon machines to fight the odds.<LINE>No caprice of probabilities could stand against infinite machines.                             
(2)Will I remain in this plane long enough to see my work finished I wonder.      
(0,1)For just how long will we have to wait for the machines to finish their part of the deal?<LINE>I have always been restless, but now I feel so... tired?
