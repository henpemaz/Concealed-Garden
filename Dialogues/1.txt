These are several sampled genome sequences, from an old creature. It is thoroughly documented, <LINE>from the activators and inhibitors to the most likely origin of the glua and other junk in it.
This creature had the unique ability of exciting nearby members of its species through radio frequency. <LINE>With this ability, that species had developed a rudimentary communication system that it used to hunt and breed. <LINE>At maximum power, its transmitting organs would heat up considerably and change color.
As part of the efforts to solve the Big Problem, many attempts were made to communicate with the fauna and flora. <LINE>These samples might have been used for engineering a purposed organism for that end.
