These are research logs on... oh, hmm... experiments conducted on live specimen.
These were conducted by a group of Triangulators in a facility not far from here. From what it is logged, <LINE>they had an array of living sentient little organisms wired to a simulation of this world, but rigged so that they would seek <LINE>personal ascension, while being monitored for vital signs and neural activity linked to ascending.
Apparently one of the subjects managed to ascend during the experiments, but there were no particularly interesting <LINE>neural activity signatures during the whole process, as if it was driven by an external force, or merely by chance.
The researchers themselves were long gone when this came to be, and the facilities computers didn't manage to draw <LINE>anything conclusive from it. The logs are accompanied by neural link profile data, but there is nothing too remarkable.

I am grateful that you are safe and well, little one.
