The beginning of the data suggests this would once contained... research logs on live specimen.
According to the first entry, these were conducted by a group of Triangulators in a facility not far from here. <LINE>Looks like they had an array of sentient organisms wired to a simulation of this world, but rigged so that they would <LINE>seek personal ascension while being monitored for signs linked to ascending.
At the end of the first log, there should be the results for the initial neural scan for test subjects. <LINE>The first three are intact, but it all ends abruptely on the fourth.
Instead there is... this. <LINE>StackOverflowException: The requested operation caused a stack overflow. AbstractCreature.Abstractize (WorldCoordinate) <0x00739>; <LINE>AbstractCreature.Abstractize (WorldCoordinate) <0x00739>; AbstractCreature.Abstractize (WorldCoordinate) <0x00739>...
The rest of the data is the same gibberish repeated over and over. I have never seen data corruption like this, little one.
Thinking about it makes me feel uneasy for some reason.
